        <h3>Returns</h3>
		<br>
        <p>
          You have 30 calendar days to return an item from the date you received
          it. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the
          same condition that you received it. Your item must be in the original
          packaging.
        </p>
		<br>
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
		<br>
        <p>
          Once we receive your item, we will inspect it and notify you that we
          have received your returned item. We will immediately notify you on
          the status of your refund after inspecting the item.
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
          If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your credit
          card (or original method of payment). You will receive the credit
          within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer's
          policies.
        </p>
